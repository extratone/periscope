We’ve seen people put their phones in some precarious situations — they’ve been taped to drones, tied to balloons and submerged underwater. Creativity always finds a way, but we wanted to [make it a little bit easier](http://GoPro.com/news). Today, you can broadcast from your GoPro HERO 4 directly to Periscope for iPhone. Keep that phone safely tucked away.

[Here’s how it works](https://help.periscope.tv/customer/portal/articles/2287095):

1. Connect to your GoPro’s WiFi, making sure it’s on video mode.

1. Open Periscope on your iPhone & tap the broadcast button.

1. The GoPro button will automatically be highlighted — so give your broadcast a title and go live.

Once you’re live, you can double tap to switch between your GoPro and iPhone cameras. There’s also a new button that locks your phone screen, so nothing is accidentally pressed while it’s safely in your pocket.

> “GoPro enables people to capture and share their experiences in the most immersive way possible, and the integration with Periscope provides GoPro users with a great, real-time platform to share their content.” — Tony Bates, President of GoPro

We see so many awesome broadcasts every day — broadcasts of things we could never have imagined, things that truly blow us away. The creativity, passion and drive of our community is incredible. We’re expecting big things with this one.

Much love,
Team Periscope
