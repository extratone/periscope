# Rewind: March 2017

Прошлое — это маяк, а не порт. | The past is a lighthouse, not a port.
 — *Old proverb*

### A spotlight on Russia

Speaking out in Russia against the government can land you in prison. Yet, last month, thousands of Russians risked arrest to have their voices heard.

On March 26, citizens across the country marched to protest alleged corruption in the government in an astonishing challenge to the leadership of Pres. Vladimir Putin.

This was the day that marked [the largest rallies in five years with a record number](http://www.rosbalt.ru/like/2017/03/27/1602341.html) of detainees.

This was the day [tens of thousands marched and 1000+ were detained](https://meduza.io/feature/2017/03/27/skolko-lyudey-vyshli-na-ulitsy-26-marta-i-skolko-zaderzhali-karta-protesta) in [82 cities](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/mass-arrests-as-anti-putin-protests-sweep-across-russia-j38sxj58j) across the Russian Federation.

The country’s main opposition leader, Alexey Navalny, organized the day-long event with his [Anti-Corruption Foundation](https://fbk.info/english/about/) (FBK) weeks prior. So yes, it was planned.

Amid the political waves, Periscopes popped up in true submarine fashion all over.

The FBK chose specifically to use Periscopes in [their 10-hour coverage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2FhmpoHMiQ) of the day. So did [VICE News Tonight](http://www.hbo.com/vice/about/article/about-vice-news-tonight.html) in English, if you prefer. Then there were the spontaneous Periscopes from ordinary people broadcasting live from the streets.

Below we have gathered a few that stood out:

[We watched as Russia’s Far East city began the protests in Vladivostok](https://www.pscp.tv/ArseniyVladcity/1mrGmevlDZkGy?t=4m15s).
