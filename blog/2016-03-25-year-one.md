# Year One

Dear Periscope Community,

Saturday marked one year since we released Periscope to the world. We’ve come a long way since then and we have you, our community, to thank.

![Time Watched represents the total amount of time spent watching live broadcasts on Periscope for iOS & Android. It does not include time spent watching broadcasts within Twitter, on the web at periscope.tv or replays.](./assets/1*e9tql8AAGe1My4wF68EwLA.png)

We’re proud of what we’ve built together and we’re excited to share just how far we’ve come. As of today, over **200 million broadcasts** have been created on Periscope and over **110 years of live video are watched every day **on iOS and Android ([*read more here](https://medium.com/@periscope/periscope-by-the-numbers-6b23dc6a1704#.hs3fv4h4a) about why we value “Time Watched” as a metric*). For everyone who joined us along the way, we hope this reaffirms that you are a part of something bigger. Thank you for making Periscope a vibrant global community– it means everything to us.

Cheers to a great first year!

Much love,
Team Periscope
