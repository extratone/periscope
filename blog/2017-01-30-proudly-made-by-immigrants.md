# Proudly Made By Immigrants

At Periscope, Kayvon and I are most proud of the team of people that we have the opportunity to work with every day. It still amazes us that so many kind, smart and generous people agreed to take this journey. The recent executive order to halt immigration from seven countries in the Middle East and Africa has forced us to consider a disturbing alternate reality in which the Periscope team is irreparably changed.

Periscope is built, maintained, and operated by people from many faiths and countries. **Without immigrants and refugees, Periscope would not exist. **For this reason, we are updating the Periscope loading screen to make a simple true statement: “Proudly made in America by immigrants.”

We feel this is an important statement to make about who we are and the real impact of these policies. We also fundamentally believe in maintaining an impartial product that gives a voice to every person in our community. Periscope has been and will always be a safe environment for people of any political and religious viewpoint. Now more than ever, Periscope is a critical tool for unfiltered, global dialogue.
 
Much love,
Joe, Kayvon & the Periscope Team
