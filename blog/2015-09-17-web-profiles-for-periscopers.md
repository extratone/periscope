# Web Profiles for Periscopers

![](./assets/1*EeAs1LKh25VOEzlByszcvQ.jpeg)

Periscope web profiles are finally here! Go to periscope.tv/username to see all the recent broadcasts for any Periscoper. If Sam Sheffer is live, you‚Äôll never again have to scramble to find the link to his broadcast. You can just go to [periscope.tv/SamSheffer](https://www.periscope.tv/SamSheffer). We think it‚Äôs really important for broadcasters to have a home on the web, and today‚Äôs launch is just the beginning.

Below are a selection of fantastic broadcasters. Make sure to check out their profiles to see recent broadcasts:

[**AJ+**](https://www.periscope.tv/ajplus) took us along with refugees crossing the Austria-Germany border, and they showed us the fire evacuation center in Clearlake, California during #ValleyFire. What we love about AJ+ is that they are leveraging their network of global reporters to bring us coverage from multiple areas all under the same Periscope channel.

[**Funny or Die](https://www.periscope.tv/funnyordie) **is guaranteed to make you laugh. Dash, John and Troy are the perfect trio. We‚Äôve played Monopoly together, made prank calls to people named Tom Brady in the Yellow Pages, and survived the rain in LA.

Warning: following [**Zagat**](https://www.periscope.tv/zagat) might make you hungry! Zagat highlights some of the very best food and drink from around the world. In the last week, we‚Äôve made cornbread ice cream sundaes at Oddfellows in Brooklyn, caught lobsters in Maine, and even gone behind the scenes at The Noble Experiment Rum Distillery.

[**Mitch Oates**](https://www.periscope.tv/lifeatseaphoto) goes surfing in Australia every morning and brings his Periscope viewers along with him. If you‚Äôve ever thought about escaping for a moment and catching some üèÑ, Mitch is your guy.

[**Mark Stone**](https://www.periscope.tv/stone_skynews) is a reporter with Sky News. He‚Äôs been on the ground covering the refugee crisis in the Middle East. Watching his journey first-hand has been incredibly powerful and educational.
