# Now LIVE: Periscope on Twitter for iOS

We’ve always wanted to make it as easy as possible to watch and broadcast live video. See the world through someone else’s eyes — that’s been our mission since day one. Today, we’re bringing this vision directly into Twitter by making it possible to watch broadcasts without leaving the Twitter app.

Since launch, there have been over 100 million broadcasts created on Periscope. Whenever a broadcast is shared on Twitter, you tap the link to open the Periscope app. Today, we’re replacing those links with the broadcast itself, autoplaying right within the Tweet. And when you tap the video, it goes full-screen and shows Periscope comments and hearts from other viewers. You don’t need the Periscope app or even a Periscope account.

Imagine scrolling through Twitter, reading about [Mitch Oates](https://www.periscope.tv/mitchoates)’ underwater adventures. You suddenly find yourself peering through a hole in your timeline out into his world, via his live broadcast. This adds a whole new dimension to Twitter.

For broadcasters, this means you can reach the massive Twitter audience. And for everyone on Twitter, there’s now a richer experience in your home timeline, search results, and on anyone’s profile who’s shared a Periscope.

We’re rolling out this feature on Twitter for iOS over the next few days. To everyone using Twitter for Android or on web: we haven’t forgotten about you! We plan to roll these features out on all platforms as soon as they’re ready.

With love,
Team Periscope and all our friends at Twitter
