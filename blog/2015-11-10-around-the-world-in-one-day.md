# Around the World in One Day

This weekend, more than 50 broadcasters organized a [Scope Day](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ScopeDay&src=tyah) that took audiences around the globe. Over the course of 24 hours, they passed the cast,* taking us to some of the word’s most iconic destinations. Here are some of our favorites:

> *Pass the cast: when a broadcaster tells the audience to join another broadcast, and then shares it with their followers — creating a waterfall effect.
